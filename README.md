# 🏡 Indian House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts house prices in India using a real-world dataset. It demonstrates a complete machine learning pipeline including data cleaning, encoding, scaling, model training, evaluation, and saving the best model for future predictions — all implemented in a Google Colab notebook.

## 📂 Dataset Description

- **Source:** [Kaggle – Housing Price Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harishkumardatalab/housing-price-prediction)
- **Format:** CSV
- **Size:** ~12,000 rows and 13 columns
- **Target Variable:** `price` (house price in INR)

### 🔍 Feature Summary:
- `area`: Total area of the house (numeric)
- `bedrooms`, `bathrooms`, `stories`: Structural features (numeric)
- `mainroad`, `guestroom`, `basement`, `hotwaterheating`, `airconditioning`, `parking`, `prefarea`: Binary categorical features (`yes`/`no`)
- `furnishingstatus`: Multi-class categorical feature (`furnished`, `semi-furnished`, `unfurnished`)

### ⚠️ Challenges:
- Missing values in both numerical and categorical columns
- Mixed data types requiring encoding
- Skewed price distribution and presence of outliers
